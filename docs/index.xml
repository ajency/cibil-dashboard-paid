See your Personalized Loan Offers Typically when we need a loan or a credit card, we approach at least 2-3 banks or financial institutions to find out interest rates and the other charges (such as processing charges). We then get all our documents in place and submit them to these lenders along with the loan application. Lenders now begin the &amp;lsquo;Loan evaluation&amp;rsquo; process by first referring your CIBIL Score and Report while assessing your application.</description>

So, what exactly does your CIBIL report contain? We are all familiar with the fear and anxiety that we feel when applying for a loan. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s the lender who decides whether we can own our dream home, our first car, or whether our children can pursue higher education. In a nutshell, a better life depends on the lender&amp;rsquo;s decision.

      <description>Myths and Facts
MYTH- CIBIL maintains list of defaulters only and having your name in CIBIL is bad.
FACT- If you have ever taken a loan or credit card from any bank or financial institution then your information is most likely with CIBIL. So your name will be with CIBIL even if you are paying all your obligations on time. RBI has mandated banks and financial institutions to submit monthly repayment data pertaining to those customers who have taken a loan or credit card with them to a Credit Bureau.</description>

      <description>What is CIBIL Score and what factors affect my CIBIL Score?
CIBIL Score is a 3 digit numeric summary of your credit history, derived by using details found in the &amp;lsquo;Accounts&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Enquiries&amp;rsquo; sections on your CIBIL Report and ranges from 300 to 900. The closer your score is to 900, the higher are the chances of your loan application getting approved.
