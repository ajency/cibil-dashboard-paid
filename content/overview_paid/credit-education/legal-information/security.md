**TransUnion Interactive, Inc. understands the confidentiality of information contained in credit reports, and we safeguard the privacy of all information you provide to us through any TransUnion Interactive website.**

**Identity Verification System (IV)**

TransUnion Interactive has designed an Identity Verification System in order to protect your security and privacy. IV seeks to confirm that your personal credit information is being viewed by YOU.

When a customer requests a credit report, IV is intended to confirm the customer's identity. If the customer cannot provide the correct information, the system does not allow that person to view the report.

(Please Note: If you are currently in the identity verification process and you need help, please contact our Customer Service Team.)

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Encryption**

To ensure that your credit information remains secure and confidential, TransUnion Interactive uses programs that encrypt the data you provide on the order form before transmission to TransUnion Interactive. Encryption is a way of coding the information in a file so that if it is intercepted by a third party as it travels over a network, it cannot be read. Only the person or persons that have the right type of decoding software can unscramble the message. Thus, your encrypted information can only be read by TransUnion Interactive.

Questions or concerns about the TransUnion Interactive's security system? Please contact the Customer Service Team.
