*Stay updated and aware of key changes in your credit profile with CIBIL Alerts.*

We have become increasingly dependent on alerts, which deliver time-sensitive information at our fingertips and help us stay connected with the world at large. Such alerts include weather forecasts, traffic updates, bank notifications, and any other time-sensitive information we might need to manage our physical and financial health.

When you are balancing the needs of your financial health with the desire to pursue your dreams, it is important to recognize the role credit plays in making those dreams a reality. Lenders check your CIBIL Score when assessing loan eligibility and credit-worthiness, thus making it one of key factors in helping you get access to credit when you need it most. So, if you are a credit-conscious individual who stays regularly updated on their credit profile, you will know that staying in touch with your status is important and that is where CIBIL Alerts comes in.

**What is CIBIL Alerts?**

CIBIL Alerts is a tool that can help you stay conscious of your day-to-day credit actions that may impact your CIBIL Score and access to loans and credit cards.

Time-sensitive alerts can help you monitor your credit score and report to take necessary actions and reduce the possibility of exposing yourself to this danger and prevent an adverse impact on your CIBIL Score. For instance, a CIBIL Alerts notification highlighting an unauthorized credit transaction or change in personal details may prompt you to immediately contact your lender or CIBIL and highlight this to them. In this case, Alerts plays a critical role in helping you stay connected to the possibility of identity theft that may damage your CIBIL Score. Not only does this help boost your credit awareness but also ensures you are eligible for access to credit when you need it the most.

**How to activate CIBIL Alerts on your profile?**

CIBIL Alerts is available with select CIBIL subscription plans as to help you stay connected with your credit profile, as well as to draw your attention to any unauthorized transaction that may indicate identity theft or credit fraud. For alerts to be enabled on your profile, you can choose a six-month or twelve-month CIBIL subscription plan.

Alerts’ real-time notifications via emails and SMSs will inform you the following changes in your CIBIL Score and Report –

* If there is a change in your CIBIL Score
* If a new loan or credit card account is added to your credit report
* If your personal information, like your address, or phone number, changes

Apart from this, to maintain good credit, you should regularly monitor your CIBIL Score and report. You should also ensure that credit expenses do not put you at risk of attracting penalties, and look out for signs of fraud. To build a strong credit profile, make sure you pay all your EMIs on time and in full, and have a healthy mix of credit accounts such as loans and credit cards. This makes you eligible for the best credit offers from leading lenders and may even help you access loans on affordable terms.
