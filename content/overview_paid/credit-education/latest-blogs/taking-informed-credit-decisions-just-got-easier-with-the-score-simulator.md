**Ever wondered how your credit actions today can impact your access to future loans and credit? Read on to know how the Score Simulator helps you take an informed credit decision.**

Imagine an alternate universe where you know how every single one of your actions may impact your future. Not only would this give you tremendous leverage over your peers, but would also make you wary of your decisions and actions, compelling you to deliberate and reconsider before behaving in a certain way.

What if you could wield this power right now? Today, access to credit at our fingertips can help us realize our financial dreams and even help us in a critical emergency. Now, imagine the possibilities if you knew how your credit actions impact your future, or more specifically, your access to future loans and credit. Intrigued?

Read on to know how you can access this power to take informed credit decisions and unlock your dreams and aspirations.

**The power of a high CIBIL Score**

One of the first things that lenders look at, when evaluating a loan application, is your credit-worthiness as reflected in your CIBIL Score and Report. The higher your score, the better are your chances of a loan approval. But do you know how you can reach that desired score? Does paying off that loan today put you on the fast track towards a high score?

Can you really predict the impact of today’s credit decision on your future access to credit?

**Stop guessing and start simulating**

Enter the **Score Simulator** — one of the latest offerings from TransUnion CIBIL. This tool allows you to explore different what-if credit scenarios/behaviors, and then generates a simulated score to help you understand how your credit actions can affect your CIBIL Score. Watch how opening a new loan account, closing an old one, paying off outstanding amounts or adding late payments can change your score and your  access to credit in the future. The highlight of this tool is that you can run multiple simulations and there will be no impact on your current CIBIL Score.
