**My loan has been rejected because of the defaults reported against my name in CIBIL records. How do I remove my name from the CIBIL's defaulters list?**

CIBIL maintains the credit history of individuals as reported by lenders. The decision to grant a loan is solely dependent on the lender's credit policy. Monitor your CIBIL Score and Report regularly and ensure you have a high score so that you are loan-ready when the need arises. It is also important to review your report and identify any possible discrepancies / errors that might be reflecting against your name, and could be responsible for pulling down your score.

**What kind of inaccuracies can reflect on my CIBIL report?**
{#bookmark1}

Your CIBIL Report includes your details and information as reported by lenders to CIBIL. In case of any inaccurate details reflecting in your CIBIL Report, you are requested to raise a dispute and highlight this to us. We will then reach out to the relevant lender and check these details.

* **Ownership:**

  If either some of the personal details or one or more accounts / enquiries on your CIBIL Report do not belong to you.

* **Incorrect personal details:**

  Lenders submit details of your credit account along with your personal / contact / employment information such as name, address, date of birth, PAN, telephone number, income etc. CIBIL then creates your complete credit profile based on these details. Hence, it is important to update your lender every time there is a change in the information as incorrect details may lead to a wrong CIBIL Report being generated.

* **Inaccurate account details:**

  Lenders generally submit data to CIBIL within a span of 30 - 45 days and if you happen to access your CIBIL Report within 45 days of your last payment of dues, it may not be updated. This leads to reflection of inaccurate current balance or amount overdue in your CIBIL Report. However, if the 'Date Reported' (date on which data is submitted by that lender) associated with that account is older than 2 months, and the payment made is still not reflecting, you can raise a dispute.

**I have Closed / Paid off the accounts and they are still showing on my report. How do I update my CIBIL report?**

As per the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act of 2005, CIBIL cannot modify any information in the database without confirmation from the relevant Credit Institution. Credit Institutions submit data every 30 - 45 days to CIBIL and if you happen to access your CIBIL Report within 45 days of closure / pay-off of your accounts it may not be updated in CIBIL records. Click here to check the updated status of your account.

**Can CIBIL make correction to the data or update / delete any information in the CIBIL Report?**

CIBIL cannot make any change directly to your CIBIL Report. Your CIBIL Report can be modified only once the change is authorized by the lender, and the details are provided to CIBIL.

**I notice a mistake in my report. How do I raise a dispute? How much time will it take to resolve the dispute?**

To initiate a dispute with us, just follow the below mentioned online dispute process. [Click here](https://www.cibil.com/self-service-portal/know-account-latest-status.action) to know more:

**Note:** You can dispute multiple fields and information on your report in a single dispute by navigating to each section on the Online Dispute Form (i.e. Personal, Contact, Employment, Account Details and Enquiry).

Once the dispute is submitted, CIBIL will also mark the relevant field/ account/ section on your credit report as "Under Dispute".

It may take approximately 30 days to resolve a dispute, subject to the time taken by the Credit Institution to respond.

**My report is incomplete. Can CIBIL add information to my CIBIL Report?**

CIBIL cannot add or delete any information directly to your CIBIL Report. The information available on your CIBIL Report is as reported to us by lenders/Credit Institutions (CIs). The onus lies with the CIs to report the complete and accurate data to CIBIL. CIBIL's responsibility lies in accurately updating and accumulating this information across CI's. Please contact your credit institution to report the missing information to CIBIL.

**I am unable to submit a dispute without entering the branch details? What can I do?**

Certain banks cannot resolve your dispute unless they have the details of the branch where you have obtained the loan from. Hence, we have automated the process of collecting the branch details from you at the time of initiating the dispute. Providing the branch details will enable the bank route your dispute to the correct branch which will help expediting the dispute process. In case you do not have the branch details, you will need to contact the respective credit institution.

**Why can't I raise more than one dispute type on a particular account / enquiry?**

You can either dispute ownership or the fields of an account / enquiry.
If you have disputed the ownership (Account does not belong to you) then disputing other fields is not relevant.
If you are disputing the field for a particular account / enquiry which belongs to you, disputing ownership is not applicable.

**What does CIBIL do once I have raised a dispute?**

Once you have submitted the dispute, CIBIL will check the dispute internally and route it to the concerned lender/credit institution. Once the CI responds to the dispute request, CIBIL will update the changes instantly (if applicable), and communicate the status to you via email.

[Click here](https://www.cibil.com/dispute-resolution) to understand the Dispute Resolution process.

**How do I know the status of my dispute?**

You will receive an automated email notification regarding the status of your dispute every 7 days.

**I had raised a dispute for correcting information on my CIBIL Report but I have received a notification that I need to contact my credit institution, Why?**

CIBIL cannot make a change to your CIBIL Report until authorized by the concerned Credit Institution/lender. This could mean that the credit institution has rejected your dispute. You will need to contact the concerned lender/Credit Institution (CI) directly for further information or you can initiate a dispute request again and we will re-verify it with the relevant CI.

**Why doesn't CIBIL verify information with consumer before updating the report?**

The information available on your CIBIL Report is as reported to CIBIL by lenders / Credit Institutions (CIs). The onus lies with the CIs to report the facts accurately to CIBIL. CIBIL's responsibility lies in accurately updating and accumulating this information across CI's. In case you find any data inaccuracy in your CIBIL Report, you can initiate a dispute with us and we will get the inaccuracies verified with the concerned CI.

**Note:** Any changes have to be authorized by the concerned CI for it to be updated in CIBIL records to reflect in your CIBIL Report.

**What if I'm not satisfied with the results of dispute?**

You can choose to contact the concerned lender/Credit Institution (CI) directly. Alternatively, you can initiate a dispute request again and we will re-verify it with the relevant CI. Please note, we cannot make any changes to your CIBIL Report without the confirmation of the respective CI.

**I see the message that certain information on the report is under dispute? What does this mean?**

As highlighted in the image below, this notification indicates that the information in certain sections of your CIBIL Report is disputed. It will be removed only once the dispute is resolved.

**How does CIBIL ensure that the credit institution or bank resolves the dispute within 30 days?**

CIBIL cannot modify any information in the database without confirmation from the relevant lender/Credit Institution. We have an automated process where a daily reminder will be sent to the bank / CI until the dispute is resolved.

**How much time does CIBIL take to update information once the bank has responded to the dispute?**

Once we get the corrected data from the lenders / Credit Institutions (CI), we update our records instantly.

**My account has not been updated for more than 2 months. What should I do?**

There could be 2 reasons why your account has not been updated:

* Credit Institution has not submitted your recent data to CIBIL
* There is an ongoing dispute on your account
