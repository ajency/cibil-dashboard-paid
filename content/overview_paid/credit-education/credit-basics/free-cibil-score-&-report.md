**What is a Free CIBIL Score and Report?**

CIBIL provides you with one CIBIL Score and Report (without any charge) once in a calendar year. However, checking once is not enough and credit-conscious consumers should monitor their CIBIL Score and Report regularly to be loan-ready whenever the opportunity and need arises.

**How do I get a Free CIBIL Score and Report from CIBIL?**

[Click here](https://myscore.cibil.com/CreditView/enrollShort.page?enterprise=CIBIL&offer=FACRA) to access your Free CIBIL Score and Report instantly:

If you do not see the 'Get your Free Report' link on the 'My Account' page it might be because you have already applied for a free CIBIL Score and Report for the year. If you have purchased any of our subscription plans, the 'Get your Free Report' link will be available after your subscription plan expires.

**What if I want another CIBIL Score and Report before one year?**

If you have already got your Free CIBIL Score and Report for the year and wish to continue monitoring your credit history, you can purchase one of our subscription plans. [Click here](/cibil-dashboard-paid/overview_paid/cibil-report/) to know more.

**Note:** You can dispute multiple fields and information on your report in a single dispute by navigating to each section on the Online Dispute Form (i.e. Personal, Contact, Employment, Account Details and Enquiry).

Once the dispute is submitted, CIBIL will also mark the relevant field/ account/ section on your credit report as "Under Dispute".

It may take approximately 30 days to resolve a dispute, subject to the time taken by the Credit Institution to respond.
