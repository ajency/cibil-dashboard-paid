realised how easy it is to fall prey to credit fraud and identity theft?

Despite the advances in the digital world, there are innumerable ways in which you can expose
your confidential information online and put yourself at risk.

Learn more about each of these techniques and how you can protect your online identity

**Phishing**

**Phishing** is an attempt to obtain any type of sensitive or personal information such as login
credentials, banking and card details or even personal identifiers (like your PAN and AADHAR
number) through deceitful means, such as impersonating another in any kind of electronic
communication. This is used by cyber criminals to trick users into revealing sensitive
confidential data simply by luring them through ***fake emails and websites.***

**Did you know** that spear-phishing is a targeted cyber-attack to trick
a specific group of people/organizations by sending emails to gain access to what they need?


**What to watch out for**
* Congratulatory or warning emails from unknown senders

* An email with a call-to-action to "click here for a prize/cashback/points"

* A mismatch in the sender's email address vis-Ã -vis the official email address

* Emails addressing you with a generic title such as "valued customer" instead of your
name

* Emails appearing to be from executive leadership you work with, requesting information
about you or colleagues that they usually do not ask for

* Unexpected emails asking for your personal information or your immediate action

**How to avoid falling prey to it**

* Do not click on links or open attachments from unknown senders

* Do not respond to or forward suspicious emails that may be a scam

* Always make sure that the sender's email address matches the official address

* If in doubt, contact the person or organization (as claimed in the email) by using
contact information provided only on their official website

* Always hover your mouse over the link to see if it will direct you to a legitimate
website

* Do not enter any personal, login, or financial information when prompted by an
unsolicited email

**Vishing**

**Vishing** (voice or VoIP phishing) is an electronic fraud tactic that can be
conducted by voice
email, VoIP (voice over IP), landline or cellular telephone. Vishing is the telephone
equivalent of phishing, where fraudsters trick the user into divulging sensitive data by
pretending to be someone else ***over a phone call***. This private information
can be used for
identity theft.

***What to watch out for***

* A caller exhibiting over-friendly behavior (calling you by your first name or making
small talk to get to know you)

* A caller who claims to work for a company or organization you trust (such as a bank, a
software vendor, police department, or government agency)

* Threatening calls reiterating a fine or charge that must be paid immediately

* Calls claiming to distribute exaggerated/fake prizes, products, or services such as
credit and loans, extended car warranties, charitable causes, or computer support

* A phone call requesting for login credentials or personal sensitive information, or
suggesting you make a payment using odd methods, like gift cards

* Pre-recorded phone call messages or robocalls.

**How to avoid falling prey to it**

* Never share sensitive information over a phone call

* Be suspicious of all unknown callers

* Always cross question the caller if you have any doubts

**Smishing**

**Smishing** stands for "SMS phishing", a security attack in which the user is tricked into
downloading a Trojan horse, virus or other malware onto his cellular phone or other mobile
device. This can also include fraudulent ***messages sent over on SMS*** to the trick user into
divulging sensitive information.

**What to watch out for**

* Suspicious messages from unknown senders

* Impersonations of a business such as your bank or mobile service provider who try to
convince you to respond to the message with information or ask you to click a link to
log into your account or provide requested information, indicating a problem with your
account and immediate action

* Text or SMS claiming you have won a prize or enticing you to click a link or send
information to be entered to win something
{.mb-20}

**How to avoid falling prey to it**

* Do not call back on a phone number provided in any suspicious SMS

* Do not trust a sender just because their sender name is an abbreviated form of an
assumed word, e.g. ICBNK

* Avoid clicking on any URL in the SMS

* Avoid downloading any app from a link mentioned in a suspicious SMS
